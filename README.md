# ML_pEC50_dopamine_receptor
This is a machine learning project to predict the drug-target binding characteristics of small molecules that are interacting with different dopamine receptors. 

* The `creating_dataset.ipynb` file describes how the dataset was created including data collection (from ChEMBL WebResource client) and feature engineering (using RDKit) steps.
* File `dopamine_pEC50_ML.ipynb` provides the detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning (ML) for the pEC50 prediction problem.
* The dataset used: `dopamine_pEC50.csv`
